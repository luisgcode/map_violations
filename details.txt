I receive daily an Excel document which we call MAP, minimum advertised price. When I receive that file, I must manually open it
and see which clients are selling below the minimum allowed price. What I want you to help me build is a simple project,
without much CSS or anything, that allows me to upload the Excel and have the system read the file and quickly identify who is violating the
minimum price and likewise prepare according to another file, maybe a JSON, prepare the templates of the emails that I'm going to send. It has to be
this way because I won't be able to connect any tool with the company's Outlook to send automatic emails or anything, they won't
allow me to do that, so I think at least generate everything else automatically and just copy and paste the emails at least. For this
I want you to first ask me all the necessary questions and let's establish the project together. For this I want to use Python. I know very little Python
so the idea is that you do 90% but I want to at least understand.
